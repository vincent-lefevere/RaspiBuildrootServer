# RaspiBuildrootServer User Manual

## Preliminary assumption

- Let's assume that the server has been installed by the administrator of the educational
institution under the name: "**buildroot.institution.uk**".".

- Let's assume that the accounts created (and used for the purposes of this user manual) are:
**student1@institution.uk**, **student2@institution.uk**, **student3@institution.uk**
and **teacher1@institution.uk**

- Finally, let's suppose that the project category created has the title "**Practical work**".

## Project group connection and access to the server:

1. Connect to the web server using the URL **https://buildroot.institution.uk/**

You start by choosing your language (French or English), then enter your login email
and the associated initial password that the teacher has given you.

**Note:** *We strongly advise you to change your password immediately.*

To do this, enter your password in the two fields at the bottom of the yellow block.
If the two passwords are identical, the "**login**" button will be deactivated and
the "**change**" button will be activated.
You can then click on it to change the connection password.
If the original password was the correct one, the new password is automatically
entered in the first password entry field above the "**login**" button.

All you have to do is click on the "**login**" button.

2. In each group, the student, designated as the project leader, clicks on the
title of the category specified by the teacher, i.e. "**Practical work**".

All the projects in the category are then displayed under the category title.
Click on the pictogram (in the shape of a large blue +), corresponding to the
creation of a new project, located after the list of projects in this category.

When you create a project, the interface will ask you, via a popup, to give it
a title that will distinguish it from your other projects (without having
to remember the identification number that will be assigned to it).

Once created, you are automatically a member of the project and you will find it
in the list of your projects under the first heading.
Here you will find the number identifying the project, the title you have given
to the project and the list of first names and surnames involved in the project.

For the time being, you must be the only participant and your colleagues will
now find the project in the list of the "**Practical work**" category, whereas
you will find it both in this list (framed by a red border) and in the list of
your projects.

3. You can now select the project you wish to work on.
